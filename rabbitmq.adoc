= RabbitMQ

This document builds on the high-level informative document about event-driven architecture. +
This is a normative document for usage and operation of RabbitMQ.

== Current use cases

Our queue messaging solution works with AWS with SQS and SNS.

SQS is a queue solution and SNS is notification service that delivers messages to multiple queues.

== Message flows

* To a queue - When publishing messages to a queue only a single subscriber can consume that message. Transport is entirely handled by SQS. (**Direct**)

* To a topic - A message (or an event) is published to a topic and delivered to a multiple queues subscribed to it. Transport is done first by SNS and then zero or more SQS queues. (**Fanout**)

== RabbitMQ transport mechanisms

RMQ uses a two component solution analogous to SNS and SQS, where every message is published to an exchange that delivers it to individual queues.

=== Queue mechanics

Every message delivered to a queue gets consumed once by a single subscriber, meaning if multiple subscribers are consuming messages from a queue, only a one of them will see a given message.

=== Exchange mechanics

Publishers in RMQ donâ€™t publish messages directly to queues, but rather to _exchanges_ that then route messages to _queues_ based on rules determined by the exchange type and queue configuration.

==== Types

* Direct - Messages get delivered directly to a queue based on the routing key, https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html#exchange-direct[docs]

** if no exchange is specified the messages are delivered directly to a queue with the same name as the routing key.

** If an exchange is specified, message is delivered to all queues subscribed to a routing key.

* Fanout - Messages are published to an exchange and delivered to all queues subscribed to it. https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html#exchange-fanout[Docs]

* Topics - Topic exchanges route messages to one or many queues based on matching between a message routing key and the pattern that was used to bind a queue to an exchange. https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html#exchange-topic[docs]

* Header - A headers exchange is designed for routing on multiple attributes that are more easily expressed as message headers than a routing key. Headers exchanges ignore the routing key attribute. Instead, the attributes used for routing are taken from the headers attribute. https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html#exchange-headers[Docs]

RMQ enables very sophisticated routing of messages, but of the purposes of an alternative to our existing use cases, the _direct_ exchanges and fanout exchanges are sufficient.
